# BaseR by Mr VooDoo

## Overview
A modern React + TypeScript web application that allows users to connect to the Base network using multiple wallet support (MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect) and interact with Ethereum smart contracts. The application performs specified numbers of clone and ping operations while displaying real-time logs. Users can also deploy real Pinger contracts, mint NFT collections, and view comprehensive wallet statistics.

**Subtitle**: 
- English: "Secure contract farming, deployment, and NFT creation on Base"
- Turkish: "Base √ºzerinde g√ºvenli kontrat farming, daƒüƒ±tƒ±m ve NFT olu≈üturma"

## Core Features

### Multi-Wallet Support and Base Network Integration
- Users can connect MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect wallets to the application
- Application specifically works on Base Mainnet (chainId: 0x2105) network
- Checks if user is on Base network before wallet connection
- Shows warning to users on wrong network to switch to Base network
- Provides button or automatic request for Base network switching/adding
- Displays wallet connection status with only wallet address and connect/disconnect buttons
- Shows connected account address
- All transactions are signed directly from user's wallet, no private keys are processed in the application

### Wallet Activity Dashboard
- After wallet connection, displays comprehensive statistics for the connected wallet on Base network
- Positioned centered directly above the Real-Time Logs section, matching the style and alignment of the logs area
- Shows total number of normal transactions sent by the wallet using optimized parallel fetching
- Displays number of owned NFTs for the connected wallet using the following logic:
  - Fetches all NFT transfers for the connected EOA using Etherscan Multichain API at https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api with chainid=8453 and API key "RDD9YF5WX8IYNCVZ76N2XIDECFMXNBZZZ7"
  - Uses `account/tokennfttx` endpoint with optimized parallel fetching, paged until empty
  - For ERC-721: For each (contract, tokenId), the owner is the address in the most recent transfer; counts as owned if to==MY_EOA and not transferred out later
  - For ERC-1155: For each (contract, tokenId), sums transfer values in/out for MY_EOA; counts as owned if balance > 0
  - Displays the total count as "Owned NFTs" in the stat box
  - Includes a "View details" link that opens a modal listing contract name/symbol, tokenId, and an optional image (if metadata URL exists)
- Shows number of contracts deployed by the wallet including both direct deploys (transactions with empty `to` field) and factory clones (using `logs/getLogs` for factory address and Cloned event topic)
- Statistics are fetched using Etherscan Multichain API at https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api with chainid=8453 and API key "RDD9YF5WX8IYNCVZ76N2XIDECFMXNBZZZ7"
- Uses optimized parallel fetching for `account/txlist` endpoint with up to 5 concurrent requests per batch, stopping when a page returns empty, with 150ms delay between batches
- Uses `logs/getLogs` endpoint for factory address to count factory-created contracts
- No backend or proxy services are used for data fetching
- Statistics are displayed in a clear, user-friendly format without description text or eye icons
- Activity rows include small icons: üìä for Transactions, üñºÔ∏è for Owned NFTs, üöÄ for Deployed Contracts
- Real-time updates when wallet connection changes
- Graceful error handling with clear messages for API unavailability, rate limiting, CORS errors, or unsupported chainid
- Implements caching for merged results (txlist + NFT stats + contract stats) in Motoko in-memory store for 300 seconds (5 minutes) to avoid redundant network requests on reloads
- Shows "Last updated" timestamp for cached data
- Shows visible spinner or loading indicator with message "Loading data from BaseScan‚Ä¶" that remains visible until all parallel batches have resolved and wallet activity data is fully loaded

### NFT Collection Minting
- "Create and Mint your NFT collection" section positioned in the left column directly below the wallet connection area
- Visually grouped with the wallet connection to maintain a clean and intuitive layout
- Section displays the nft.jpg image prominently and centered, sized to approximately 25% of the viewport width (responsive for both desktop and mobile)
- Two input fields:
  - Handle (string, required): Text input for collection handle without any prefix added, must be non-empty
    - Turkish label: "Koleksiyon Adƒ±" (instead of "Tanƒ±tƒ±cƒ±")
  - Amount (integer, 1-10, required): Dropdown select field allowing user to choose from values 1 through 10, styled consistently with the rest of the app and accessible on both desktop and mobile
- Submit button to initiate minting process
- Interacts with NFTFactory contract at address 0xfC92711490c25eBcF73e91CC549007369f0A22F8
- Uses only the provided ABI for createMyCollection function:
  - Function signature: createMyCollection(string handle, uint256 amount) returns (address collection)
  - Function is nonpayable (no value sent with transaction)
  - Function selector is always 0x703270d8 (for createMyCollection(string,uint256))
- Encodes the function call using ethers.Interface.encodeFunctionData with the specified ABI
- Uses wallet-suggested gas pricing (no manual gasPrice or gasLimit unless gas estimation fails)
- Uses Base Mainnet RPC endpoint for all contract interactions
- After transaction completion, displays:
  - Transaction hash
  - Transaction status (success/failure)
  - Gas used
  - New collection address (from function return value)
- All minting operations are logged in the real-time logs panel
- Error handling for failed transactions or invalid inputs
- Input validation ensures handle is non-empty and amount is between 1 and 10

### Contract Deployment Options
- "Deploy A Contract üöÄ" button located in the right column with green or blue Web3-style color
  - Turkish: "Kontrat Deploy Et üöÄ" button
- When clicked, deploys real contract using ethers.ContractFactory with Pinger.sol ABI and BYTECODE
- Deployment is performed using connected wallet (signer)
- After deployment, new contract address and transaction details are logged in the log panel
- Both "Clone Deploy" (minimal proxy with Factory.createClone) and "Deploy Contract" (direct contract deployment) modes available in the right column
  - Turkish: "Kontrat Deploy Et" for Deploy Contract mode
- Clear distinction between the two deployment modes

### Transaction Parameters
- Fixed Factory address: 0x0ae36d90d4e295a4b87274eec0c1520fd5f6f842

  - Shows only MinGas(createClone) = 180,000 and MinGas(ping) = 50,000 fields
  - Transaction options include only gasLimit, no maxFeePerGas or maxPriorityFeePerGas

- GasBuffer = 20% (always shown regardless of mode)
- Users can optionally modify these values

### Smart Contract Interaction
- Communication with Factory contract (0x0ae36d90d4e295a4b87274eec0c1520fd5f6f842) on Base network using ethers.js
- Factory contract ABI is defined exactly as:
  - "event Cloned(address indexed addr)" event
  - "function createClone() returns (address)" function
- Communication with NFTFactory contract (0xfC92711490c25eBcF73e91CC549007369f0A22F8) on Base network using ethers.js
- NFTFactory contract uses only the specified ABI for createMyCollection function with function selector 0x703270d8
- Contract interaction uses only ethers.Contract with factory.createClone() call
- Verifies that createClone function selector is 0x64f2d4b9 and displays in logs
- Does not use old function calls like factory.clone() or factory["clone(address)"]()
- Pinger contract ABI includes:
  - "function ping()" function
  - "function counter() view returns (uint256)" function
- Real contract deployment using ethers.ContractFactory with Pinger.sol ABI and BYTECODE

- All gas parameters are sent directly from browser to wallet
- No proxy, relay, or backend transaction signing/forwarding is used
- No cached or old ABI/function signatures are used
- Follows ethers v6 transaction pattern
- NFT minting uses ethers.Interface.encodeFunctionData for function call encoding and wallet-suggested gas pricing
